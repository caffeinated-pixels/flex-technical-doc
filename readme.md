# Flexbox Technical documentation

A web page I made for the [Build a Product Landing Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page) freeCodeCamp challenge.

All the code is my work, but the article content used for creating the page was been taken from [Flexbox - Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) by [Mozilla Contributors](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox$history), which is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).

See the [technical documentation page in action](https://cssflex-tech-doc.netlify.app/) here.
